This is an impossible list of things I want to do or learn. Usually I keep
them in small pieces of paper, so I miss lots of them. This is a attempt of
Keeping them ordered or, at least, reduce the amount of ued paper.

* [ ] BBQ app with nest and the blog entry about the process
* [ ] Solve coding problems
* [ ] Read the two bundles that I purchased
* [ ] Revisit the master material and implement it in â€¦ nest? quarkus?
micronaut? updated spring version? T, W, F 17:30 - 20?
* [ ] Write about DDD and CQRS
* [ ] Implement the prim algorithm and other algorithms that I learnt at the university
* [ ] Make a finite state machine
