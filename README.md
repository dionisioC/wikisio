# [Wikisio](https://dionisioC.github.io/wikisio)

This is my personal wiki where I share what I learn in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dionisioC/wikisio).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web format](https://dionisioC.github.io/wikisio).**

## Contributing

If you find a mistake or want to add new content, please make the changes. You
can use the edit button on the top right of any article to add them in a pull
request, if you don't know what that means, you can always open an
[issue](https://github.com/dionisioC/wikisio/issues/new).

## Thanks

The skeleton of the wiki has been taken from [The Blue
Book](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book)
